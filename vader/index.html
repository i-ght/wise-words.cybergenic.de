      <h1>WISE WORDS OF VADER</h1>
      <ul id="quotes">
        <li><p>“Leave that to me.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“There’ll be no one to stop us this time!”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Don’t be too proud of this technological terror you’ve constructed.
          The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of
          the Force.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“I find your lack of faith disturbing.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“As you wish.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence
          of my old master.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Don’t underestimate the Force.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“The Force is with him.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Escape may not be his plan. I must face him alone.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“I’ve been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The
          circle is now complete.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Your powers are weak, old man.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“The Force is strong with this one!”</p></li>
        <li><p>“I have you now!”</p></li>
        <li><p>“He is as clumsy as he is stupid.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not
          excuses.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“I have felt it.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“He will join us or die, my master.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“You are free to use any means necessary, but I want them alive. No
          disintegrations.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Apology accepted, Captain Needa.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along
          their last know trajectory.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Don’t fail me again, Admiral.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“We would be honored if you would join us.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“He will not be permanently damaged.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Perhaps you think you’re being treated unfairly.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison
          here.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!”</p></li>
        <li><p>“I am altering the deal. Pray I don’t alter it any further.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi
          yet.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“You have learned much, young one.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be
          true.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor
          thought.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Impressive… most impressive.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear… now
          release your anger.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Only your hatred can destroy me.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don’t let yourself be
          destroyed as Obi-Wan did.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“There is no escape. Don’t make me destroy you. You do not yet
          realize your importance. You have only begun to discover your power.
          Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength,
          we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the
          galaxy.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“If you only knew the power of the dark side.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“No. I am your father.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Search your feelings. You know it to be true.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your
          destiny. Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son.
          Come with me. It is the only way”</p></li>
        <li><p>“You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I’m here to put
          you back on schedule.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the
          situation.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your
          apparent lack of progress.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as
          forgiving as I am.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“The Emperor will see me, now!”</p></li>
        <li><p>“The Emperor has been expecting you.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor
          has foreseen.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“If that is your destiny.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“It is pointless to resist, my son.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“You are unwise to lower your defenses!”</p></li>
        <li><p>“You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not
          fight, then you will meet your destiny.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save
          your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are
          strong. Especially for…”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Sister! So…you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed
          her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is
          complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she
          will.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Luke, help me take this mask off.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Nothing can stop that now. Just for once… let me look on you with
          my own eyes.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Now…go, my son. Leave me.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your
          sister…you were right.”</p></li>
