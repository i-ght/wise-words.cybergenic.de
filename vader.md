# WISE WORDS OF VADER
- "Leave that to me."
- "There'll be no one to stop us this time!"
- "Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've
constructed. The ability to
destroy a planet is insignificant
next to the power of the Force."
- "I find your lack of faith disturbing."
- "As you wish."
- "A tremor in the Force. The last
time I felt it was in the presence
of my old master."
- "Don't underestimate the Force."
- "The Force is with him."
- "Escape may not be his plan. I must face him alone."
- "I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again, at last. The circle
is now complete."
- "When I left you, I was but the
learner; now I am the master."
- "Your powers are weak, old man."
- "The Force is strong with this one!"
- "I have you now!"
- "He is as clumsy as he is stupid."
- "You have failed me for the last time, Admiral."
- "Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses."
- "I have felt it."
- "If he could be turned, he would 
		become a powerful ally."
- "He will join us or die, my master."
- "You are free to use any means necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations."
- "Apology accepted, Captain Needa."
- "Alert all commands.  Calculate 
		every possible destination along 
		their last know trajectory."
- "Don't fail me again, Admiral."
- "We would be honored if you would join us."
- "He will not be permanently damaged."
- "Perhaps you think you're being 
		treated unfairly."
- "Good.  It would be unfortunate if 
		I had to leave a garrison here."
- "The Empire will compensate you 
		if he dies.  Put him in!"
- "I am altering the deal.  Pray I 
		don't alter it any further."
- "The Force is with you, young 
		Skywalker.  But you are not a 
		Jedi yet."
- "You have learned much, young one."
- "Your destiny lies with me, 
		Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to 
		be true."
- "All to easy.  Perhaps you are not 
		as strong as the Emperor thought."
- "Impressive... most impressive."
- "Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You 
		have controlled your fear... now 
		release your anger."
- "Only your hatred can destroy me."
- "You are beaten.  It is useless 
		to resist.  Don't let yourself 
		be destroyed as Obi-Wan did."
- "There is no escape.  Don't make 
		me destroy you.  You do not yet 
		realize your importance.  You 
		have only begun to discover your 
		power.  Join me and I will complete 
		your training.  With our combined 
		strength, we can end this destructive 
		conflict and bring order to the 
		galaxy."
- "If you only knew the power of the 
		dark side."
- "No.  I am your father."
- "Search your feelings.  You know 
		it to be true."
- "Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
		He has foreseen this.  It is your 
		destiny.  Join me, and together 
		we can rule the galaxy as father 
		and son.  Come with me.  It is the 
		only way"
- "You may dispense with the pleasantries,
Commander. I'm here to put you back on
schedule."
- "Perhaps I can find new ways to
motivate them."
- "The Emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation."
- "That is correct, Commander. And he is most
displeased with your apparent lack of
progress."
- "I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The
Emperor is not as forgiving as I am."
- "The Emperor will see me, now!"
- "The Emperor has been expecting you."
- "I see you have constructed a new lightsaber."
- "Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are
powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen."
- "If that is your destiny."
- "It is pointless to resist, my son."
- "You are unwise to lower your defenses!"
- "You underestimate the power of the dark side.
If you will not fight, then you will meet
your destiny."
- "Give yourself to the dark side. It is the
only way you can save your friends. Yes, your
thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them
are strong. Especially for..."
- "Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your
feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan
was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure
is complete. If you will not turn to the dark
side, then perhaps she will."
- "Luke, help me take this mask off."
- "Nothing can stop that now. Just for once...
let me look on you with my own eyes."
- "Now...go, my son. Leave me."
- "You already have, Luke. You were right about
me. Tell your sister...you were right."
