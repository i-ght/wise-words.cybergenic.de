      <h1>WISE WORDS OF DR. LECTOR</h1>
      <h2>(From “Hannibal” TV show)</h2>
      <ul id="quotes">
        <li>
          <p>“Our brain is designed to experience anxiety in short bursts, not
            the prolonged foamy lathers of duress your neuroses seem to enjoy. It’s
            why you feel as though a lion were on the verge of devouring you.</p>
          <p>You have to convince yourself the lion is not in the room. When it
            is, I assure you, you will know it.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I hate to be discourteous.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“You may wait in the waiting room.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I imagine what you see and learn touches everything else in your
            mind. Your values and decency are present yet shocked at your
            associations, appalled at your dreams. No forts in the bone arena of
            your skull for things you love.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“It’s involuntary. He couldn’t stop himself if he tried. What he
            has is pure empathy. And projection. He can assume your point of view,
            or mine – and maybe some other points of view that scare him. It’s an
            uncomfortable gift, Jack. Perception’s a tool that’s pointed on both
            ends.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m very careful about what I put into my body. Which means I
            end up preparing most meals myself.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Or we could socialize like adults, god forbid we become
            friendly.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“The mathematics of human behavior. All those ugly variables.
            Some bad math with this shrike fellow. Are you reconstructing his
            fantasies? What kind of problems does he have?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>(In response to Will asking, “How do you see me?”) “The mongoose
            I want under the house when the snakes slither by.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Mister Garrett Jacob Hobbs? You don’t know me and I suspect
            we’ll never meet. This is a courtesy call. Listen very carefully. Are
            you listening? They know.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m not sure therapy will work on you. Stealing into other minds
            has taught you how to fortify your own.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“What you need is a way out of dark places when Jack sends you
            there.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“You saved Abigail Hobbs’ life. You also orphaned her. It comes
            with certain emotional obligations, regardless of empathy disorders.</p>
          <p>I feel a staggering amount of obligation. I feel responsibility. I’ve
            fantasized about scenarios where my actions may have allowed a different
            fate for Abigail Hobbs.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“It’s whatever you need it to be. Will, the mirrors in your mind
            can reflect the best of yourself and not the worst of someone
            else.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Is it harder imagining the thrill somebody else feels killing
            now that you’ve done it yourself?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“The structure of a fungus mirrors that of the human brain. An
            intricate web of connections.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Is that what your Farmer is looking for? Some sort of
            connection.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m very supportive of bake-offs. It’s important you find
            someone you’re comfortable with.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“You’ve been terribly rude, Miss Lounds. What’s to be done about
            that?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I lost the stick, kept the carrot.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“As a psychiatric professional, I feel duty-bound to point out
            that blackmailing somebody into therapy tends to negate positive
            benefits.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m sure he recognizes the necessity of his own support
            structure.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Are you not accustomed to broken ponies in your
            stable?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I want to understand why you’re so delicate with Will. Because
            you don’t trust him or because you’re afraid of losing another
            pony?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Then it’s not Hobbs’ ghost that’s haunting you, is it? It’s the
            inevitability of there being a man so bad that killing him felt
            good.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Which is why you’re here. To prove that sprig of zest you feel
            is from saving Abigail not killing her dad.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“If your intention was to kill him, it’s because you understand
            why he did the things he did. It’s beautiful in it’s own way. Giving
            voice to the unmentionable.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“It wasn’t the act of killing Hobbs that got you down, was it?
            Did you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Killing must feel good to God, too. He does it all the time, and
            are we not created in his image?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“God’s terrific. He dropped a church roof on thirty-four of his
            worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas, while they sang a hymn.”
            (Will asks, “Did god feel good about that?”) (Hannibal replies, “He felt
            powerful.”)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“It is odd, but not unheard of for the comatose or anesthetized
            to recall word for word conversations that took place in their
            presence.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“There was no vocabulary for your mind to articulate the
            violence.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“there is a scenario where revisiting the trauma event could help
            Abigail heal and actually prevent denial.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“One can not be delusional if the belief in question is accepted
            as ordinary by others in that person’s culture or subculture. Or
            family.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I can help you, if you ask me to. At great risk to my career and
            my life. You have a choice. You can tell them you were defending
            yourself when you gutted this man… or we can hide the body.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Far from shores that would breach the hull structure of your
            mind. What dark waters would they let in?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Reassuring to recognize when the bolt of our fates slides
            home.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“One can certainly lose perspective tucked away for weeks in an
            ivory tower.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Spending each day immersed in tragedy may be doing more harm
            than good. Abigail should be out in the world finding her footing,
            giving her the confidence to move forward.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Passion’s good. Gets blood pumping.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“He developed a theory that great cultures meet their ends solely
            as a result of their cuisines becoming too decadent.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“We don’t know what nightmares lie coiled beneath Will’s
            pillow.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“The first small bond to a killer itches and stings like a leech,
            that may be the distraction.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Children transport us to our childhoods. Will may feel the tug
            of life before the FBI, before you. Simpler times in boat yards with
            dad. That life is an anchor streamed behind him in heavy weather. He
            needs an anchor, Jack.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I would certainly feel safer if you were in the hallowed halls
            of the F.B.I. protecting my interests.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“We don’t invent our natures, Abigail. They’re issued to us, with
            our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Can’t fight it.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Our scars have the power to remind us that the past was real.
            Anchors us. We all need to be anchored.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Have you ever taken psilocybin?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“There are those psychiatrists who believe altered states could
            be used to access traumatic memories.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Which is why we need to supplement them (bad memories) with
            positive associations. No more bad dreams, Abigail.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I want you to do this drug. With my supervision. Where it’s
            safe.</p>
          <p>(offers her cup)</p>
          <p>Do you trust me?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“You and I will have many secrets.</p>
          <p>Infusing psilocybin into the bloodstream before psychotherapy can
            elicit a positive, even spiritual, experience for patients.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Psychological trauma is an affliction of the powerless. I want
            to give you your power back.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Taste is not only biochemical, it’s also psychological, evoking
            memories of places and experiences.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“You have every right to be upset with me. I overstepped my
            bounds.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“First and worst sign of sociopathic behavior – cruelty to
            animals.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I have no taste for animal cruelty. The goose, in this case the
            gander, is not force fed. It eats only as much as it chooses and only in
            its natural environment.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“At my table, just the cruel deserve cruelty, Mrs. Crawford.
            Which is why I employ an ethical butcher.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m afraid I insist on it. No need for unnecessary suffering.
            Human emotions are gifts from our animal ancestors. Cruelty is the gift
            humanity has given itself.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Your perfume is exquisite, similar to the aroma on the air just
            after lightning strikes.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I first noticed my keen sense of smell when I was a young man. I
            was aware one of my teachers had stomach cancer even before he
            did.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I wouldn’t say forced. Manipulated would be the word I’d
            choose.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Somewhere between denying horrible events and calling them out
            lies the truth of psychological trauma.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Your experience may’ve overwhelmed ordinary functions that give
            you a sense of control.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“There’s no one and only spiritual center of the brain. Any idea
            of God comes from many areas of the mind working together in
            unison.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“It’s hard to lie still and fear going to sleep when it’s there
            to think about. You listen to your breathing in the dark and the tiny
            clicks of your blinking eyes.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I dare in many varied ways, but I promise… I’m much more
            forgiving of the unorthodox than Dr. Bloom.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“It can sometimes be brave to allow yourself hope.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“She’s lost hope. Which means you can’t.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Take control.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I will again. Once inspiration strikes. I cannot force a feast.
            A feast must present itself.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I prefer we call it a human shield.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I have friends. And the opportunities for friends.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Having a better understanding of why people do what they do
            doesn’t make it any easier to socialize.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I cope.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Valuable organs.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“It’s not what you appreciate. It’s that you appreciate. A
            compromise.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I love your pallet.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m honest.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m not analyzing your friend. I’m analyzing your perception of
            him. May help you know yourself better. You could be projecting onto him
            what you consider to be your flaws.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“You’re not a psychopath. Although you may be attracted to
            them.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Among the first musical instruments were flutes carved from
            human bone.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Every life is a piece of music. Like music, we are finite
            events, unique arrangements. Sometimes harmonious, sometimes
            dissonant.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there
            olive oil?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>(In reply to “What if I’ wrong?”) “What if you’re
            right?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I discover. Can’t impose traditional composition on an
            instrument that’s inherently free form.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“What stopped you from wanting to kill me? Or have you
            stopped?”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I know exactly how you feel. But I don’t want to be your
            friend.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“That’s why you kissed her. A clutch for balance.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m also part of the problem. You focus too much on your
            therapist and not enough on your therapy.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I thought this was a simple matter of poor choice in
            friends.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I got here on my own. But I appreciate the company.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You’re disassociating, Will. It’s a desperate survival mechanism
            for a psyche that endures repeated abuse.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“You have an empathy disorder. What you feel is overwhelming you.
            Yet you choose to ignore it. That is the abuse I’m referring
            to.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“What about your life?</p>
          <p>I’m your friend, Will. I don’t care about the lives you save. I care
            about your life. And your life is separating from reality.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“In some cultures, crimes and guilt are made manifest so that
            everyone can see them and see their shame.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“You’re safe, Abigail. No-one will know what you did. And no-one
            will know the truth you’re trying to avoid. The one you cannot admit
            even to yourself.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“We both know the unreality of taking a life, of people who die
            when we have no other choice. We know in those moments they’re not
