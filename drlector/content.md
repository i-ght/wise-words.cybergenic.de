# WISE WORDS OF DR. LECTOR
## (From "Hannibal" TV show)

- "Our brain is designed to experience anxiety in short bursts, not the prolonged foamy lathers of duress your neuroses seem to enjoy. It’s why you feel as though a lion were on the verge of devouring you.

  You have to convince yourself the lion is not in the room. When it is, I assure you, you will know it."
- "I hate to be discourteous."
- "You may wait in the waiting room."
- "I imagine what you see and learn touches everything else in your mind. Your values and decency are present yet shocked at your associations, appalled at your dreams. No forts in the bone arena of your skull for things you love."
- "It’s involuntary. He couldn’t stop himself if he tried. What he has is pure empathy. And projection. He can assume your point of view, or mine -- and maybe some other points of view that scare him. It’s an uncomfortable gift, Jack. Perception’s a tool that’s pointed on both ends."
- "I’m very careful about what I put into my body. Which means I end up preparing most meals myself."
- "Or we could socialize like adults, god forbid we become friendly."
- "The mathematics of human behavior. All those ugly variables. Some bad math with this shrike fellow. Are you reconstructing his fantasies? What kind of problems does he have?"
- (In response to Will asking, "How do you see me?")
  "The mongoose I want under the house when the snakes slither by."
- "Mister Garrett Jacob Hobbs? You don’t know me and I suspect we’ll never meet. This is a courtesy call. Listen very carefully. Are you listening? They know."
- "I'm not sure therapy will work on you. Stealing into other minds has taught you how to fortify your own."
- "What you need is a way out of dark places when Jack sends you there."
- "You saved Abigail Hobbs' life. You also orphaned her. It comes with certain emotional obligations, regardless of empathy disorders.

  I feel a staggering amount of obligation. I feel responsibility. I've fantasized about scenarios where my actions may have allowed a different fate for Abigail Hobbs."
- "It's whatever you need it to be. Will, the mirrors in your mind can reflect the best of yourself and not the worst of someone else."
- "Is it harder imagining the thrill somebody else feels killing now that you've done it yourself?"
- "The structure of a fungus mirrors that of the human brain. An intricate web of connections."
- "Is that what your Farmer is looking for? Some sort of connection."
- "I'm very supportive of bake-offs. It's important you find someone you're comfortable with."
- "You've been terribly rude, Miss Lounds. What's to be done about that?"
- "I lost the stick, kept the carrot."
- "As a psychiatric professional, I feel duty-bound to point out that blackmailing somebody into therapy tends to negate positive benefits."
- "I'm sure he recognizes the necessity of his own support structure."
- "Are you not accustomed to broken ponies in your stable?"
- "I want to understand why you're so delicate with Will. Because you don't trust him or because you're afraid of losing another pony?"
- "Then it's not Hobbs' ghost that's haunting you, is it? It's the inevitability of there being a man so bad that killing him felt good."
- "Which is why you're here. To prove that sprig of zest you feel is from saving Abigail not killing her dad."
- "If your intention was to kill him, it's because you understand why he did the things he did. It's beautiful in it's own way. Giving voice to the unmentionable."
- "It wasn't the act of killing Hobbs that got you down, was it? Did you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?"
- "Killing must feel good to God, too. He does it all the time, and are we not created in his image?"
- "God's terrific. He dropped a church roof on thirty-four of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas, while they sang a hymn."
  (Will asks, "Did god feel good about that?")
  (Hannibal replies, "He felt powerful.")
- "It is odd, but not unheard of for the comatose or anesthetized to recall word for word conversations that took place in their presence."
- "There was no vocabulary for your mind to articulate the violence."
- "there is a scenario where revisiting the trauma event could help Abigail heal and actually prevent denial."
- "One can not be delusional if the belief in question is accepted as ordinary by others in that person’s culture or subculture. Or family."
- "I can help you, if you ask me to. At great risk to my career and my life. You have a choice. You can tell them you were defending yourself when you gutted this man... or we can hide the body."
- "Far from shores that would breach the hull structure of your mind. What dark waters would they let in?"
- "Reassuring to recognize when the bolt of our fates slides home."
- "One can certainly lose perspective tucked away for weeks in an ivory tower."
- "Spending each day immersed in tragedy may be doing more harm than good. Abigail should be out in the world finding her footing, giving her the confidence to move forward."
- "Passion’s good. Gets blood pumping."
- "He developed a theory that great cultures meet their ends solely as a result of their cuisines becoming too decadent."
- "We don’t know what nightmares lie coiled beneath Will’s pillow."
- "The first small bond to a killer itches and stings like a leech, that may be the distraction."
- "Children transport us to our childhoods. Will may feel the tug of life before the FBI, before you. Simpler times in boat yards with dad. That life is an anchor streamed behind him in heavy weather. He needs an anchor, Jack."
- "I would certainly feel safer if you were in the hallowed halls of the F.B.I. protecting my interests."
- "We don’t invent our natures, Abigail. They’re issued to us, with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Can’t fight it."
- "Our scars have the power to remind us that the past was real. Anchors us. We all need to be anchored."
- "Have you ever taken psilocybin?"
- "There are those psychiatrists who believe altered states could be used to access traumatic memories."
- "Which is why we need to supplement them (bad memories) with positive associations. No more bad dreams, Abigail."
- "I want you to do this drug. With my supervision. Where it’s safe.
  
  (offers her cup)
  
  Do you trust me?"
- "You and I will have many secrets.

  Infusing psilocybin into the bloodstream before psychotherapy can elicit a positive, even spiritual, experience for patients."
- "Psychological trauma is an affliction of the powerless. I want to give you your power back."
-  "Taste is not only biochemical, it’s also psychological, evoking memories of places and experiences."
- "You have every right to be upset with me. I overstepped my bounds."
- "First and worst sign of sociopathic behavior -- cruelty to animals."
- "I have no taste for animal cruelty. The goose, in this case the gander, is not force fed. It eats only as much as it chooses and only in its natural environment."
- "At my table, just the cruel deserve cruelty, Mrs. Crawford. Which is why I employ an ethical butcher."
- "I’m afraid I insist on it. No need for unnecessary suffering. Human emotions are gifts from our animal ancestors. Cruelty is the gift humanity has given itself."
- "Your perfume is exquisite, similar to the aroma on the air just after lightning strikes."
- "I first noticed my keen sense of smell when I was a young man. I was aware one of my teachers had stomach cancer even before he did."
- "I wouldn’t say forced. Manipulated would be the word I’d choose."
- "Somewhere between denying horrible events and calling them out lies the truth of psychological trauma."
- "Your experience may’ve overwhelmed ordinary functions that give you a sense of control."
- "There’s no one and only spiritual center of the brain. Any idea of God comes from many areas of the mind working together in unison."
- "It’s hard to lie still and fear going to sleep when it’s there to think about. You listen to your breathing in the dark and the tiny clicks of your blinking eyes."
- "I dare in many varied ways, but I promise... I’m much more forgiving of the unorthodox than Dr. Bloom."
- "It can sometimes be brave to allow yourself hope."
- "She’s lost hope. Which means you can’t."
- "Take control."
- "I will again. Once inspiration strikes. I cannot force a feast. A feast must present itself."
- "I prefer we call it a human shield."
-  "I have friends. And the opportunities for friends."
- "Having a better understanding of why people do what they do doesn’t make it any easier to socialize."
- "I cope."
- "Valuable organs."
- "It’s not what you appreciate. It’s that you appreciate. A compromise."
- "I love your pallet."
- "I'm honest."
- "I’m not analyzing your friend. I’m analyzing your perception of him. May help you know yourself better. You could be projecting onto him what you consider to be your flaws."
- "You’re not a psychopath. Although you may be attracted to them."
- "Among the first musical instruments were flutes carved from human bone."
- "Every life is a piece of music. Like music, we are finite events, unique arrangements. Sometimes harmonious, sometimes dissonant."
- "Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there olive oil?"
- (In reply to "What if I' wrong?") "What if you’re right?"
- "I discover. Can’t impose traditional composition on an instrument that’s inherently free form."
- "What stopped you from wanting to kill me? Or have you stopped?"
- "I know exactly how you feel. But I don’t want to be your friend."
- "That’s why you kissed her. A clutch for balance."
- "I’m also part of the problem. You focus too much on your therapist and not enough on your therapy."
- "I thought this was a simple matter of poor choice in friends."
- "I got here on my own. But I appreciate the company."
- You’re disassociating, Will. It’s a desperate survival mechanism for a psyche that endures repeated abuse."
- "You have an empathy disorder. What you feel is overwhelming you. Yet you choose to ignore it. That is the abuse I’m referring to."
- "What about your life?

  I’m your friend, Will. I don’t care about the lives you save. I care about your life. And your life is separating from reality."
- "In some cultures, crimes and guilt are made manifest so that everyone can see them and see their shame."
- "You’re safe, Abigail. No-one will know what you did. And no-one will know the truth you’re trying to avoid. The one you cannot admit even to yourself."
- "We both know the unreality of taking a life, of people who die when we have no other choice. We know in those moments they’re not flesh, but light and air and color."
- "Those memories sank out of sight, yet you’re aware of their absence."
- "You must overcome these delusions that are disguising your reality."
- "You have to honestly confront your limitations with what you do and how it affects you."
- "Opportunity."
- "The problem Will has is too many mirror neurons. Our heads are filled with them when we’re children. Supposed to help us socialize and melt away. But Will held onto his, which makes knowing who he is a challenge. He’s always reflecting those around him."
- "When you take him to a crime scene, Jack, the very air has screams smeared on it. In those places, he doesn’t just reflect, he absorbs."
- "If there were ever anything that might be of therapeutic value to others, I’d abstract it in a form that’d be totally unrecognizable."
- "Even those closest to her could seem like imposters. She can’t trust anything or anyone she once knew to be trustworthy. Her mental illness won’t let her.

  Have you ever felt that way, Will?"
- "Imagination is an interesting accelerant for a fever."
- "Now we’ve confirmed what it is. It’ll be easier to hide from him."
- "Someone who already doubts their own identity can be more susceptible to manipulation."
- "Dr. Gideon is a psychopath. Psychopaths are narcissists. They rarely doubt who they are."
- "Psychic driving fails because its methods are too obvious."
- "If force is used, the subject will only surrender temporarily."
- "Once a patient is exposed to the method of the manipulation, it becomes much less effective."
- "...he pushed back. The subject mustn’t be aware of any influence. The only motivation one needs is loneliness or mild depression."
- "A terrible thing to have your identity taken from you."
- "our experiences shape us"
- "Madness can be a medicine for the modern world. You take it in moderation, it's beneficial."
- "Side effects can be temporary. They can be a boost to our psychological immune systems to help fight the existential crises of normal life."
- "And I hope you're her's. Nothing more isolating than mental illness."
- "When the pressures of my personal and professional relationships with Will grow too great, I assure you I'll find a way to relieve them."
- "I never considered having a child. But after meeting Abigail, I understood the appeal. The opportunity to guide and support, and in many ways, direct a life."
- "I think of my earliest memory and project forward to what I imagine will be my death. I never think about living beyond that span of time. Except by reputation."
- "It’s hard to accept that I could fail them both so profoundly."
- "If you are this killer, that identity runs through these events like a thread through pearls."
- "You catch these killers, Will, by getting into their heads, but you also let them into yours."
- "At a time when other men first see and fear their isolation, yours has become understandable to you. You are alone because you are unique."
- "More than I would care to admit. Psychiatrists can have divided loyalties. We have to protect our patients from becoming victims of the pressures we face to help them."
- "I never feel guilty eating anything."
- "He sees his own mentality as grotesque but useful, like a chair of antlers. He can't anticipate his thoughts. He can't block them. He can't repress who he is. There's an honesty in that I admire."
- "There is a power differential between psychiatrist and patient. One that I'm well aware of, particularly with my own therapist."
- "When it comes to nature versus nurture, I choose neither. We are built from a DNA blueprint and born into a world of scenario and circumstance we don't control."
- "Those in the world around him are a means to an end. He uses them to do what he is driven to do."
- "As a friend, I’m telling you not to force an issue for the short-term emotional satisfaction it can have."
- "Psychopathic violence is predominantly goal-oriented, a means to a very particular end."
- "I've always found the idea of death comforting. The thought that my life could end at any moment frees me to fully appreciate the beauty, art and horror of everything this world has to offer."
- "The strobe causes neurons to fire en masse -- like striking many piano keys at once. The dissonance might foster a change in your mind."
- "Because you don't know what you can trust to be true. You only know what you wish to be true. That can be taken advantage of, Will. We both know it is a painstaking process to reconstruct a coherent personal history, piece by piece, when so many pieces are missing."
- "We evolved the ability to communicate disappointment to teach those around us good manners."
- "We both have to transform our misfortunes into life-enhancing events. We have to facilitate our own post-traumatic growth, Jack. We have to strengthen our social ties and resist the temptation to brood."
- "Most stable elements, Alana, appear in the middle of the periodic table. Roughly between iron and silver. Between iron and silver, I think that is appropriate for you. Between strength and elegance."
- "The tragedy is not to die, Abel, but to be wasted."
- "The most-important aspect of a successful recovery is recognizing that life will never be the same."
- "First you have to grieve for what is lost and what has changed."
- "More flavorful and firm than farmed specimens. I find the trout to be a very Nietzsche-ian fish. Trials of his wild existence find their way into the flavor of the flesh."
- "Which is why we need to move past apologies and forgiveness."
- "We will absorb this experience and it will change us. We are all Nietzsche-ian fish in that regard"
- "Greatest crime now would be to walk away from what we've shared and suffered. In many ways, we need each other. We're the only ones who will know what this feels like."
- "I agree with the pagans. The horse is divine. All beasts of burden are sacred animals."
- "Which is why sacrificial animals should be healthy, without any defects."
- "You are no more at fault for what happened to you than if you had been bitten by a mad dog."
- "Doing bad things to bad people makes us feel good. Did you feel good trying to kill your brother?"
- "I am ethically obligated to take action to prevent that murder. Be that as it may, if there’s no one else to protect you, Margot, you have to protect yourself. It would actually have been more therapeutic if you had killed him."
- "Do you fantasize about killing me? Tell me. How would you do it?"
- "Then we haven't moved past apologies and forgiveness."
- "That doing bad things to bad people makes you feel good?"
- "Every human being is capable of committing acts of great cruelty."
- "Your brother dehumanized you and your family unfortunately fosters that climate of disrespect."
- "I’m much weirder than you will ever be, Margot. It’s fine to be weird."
- "Anger is an energizing emotion; prompts action against threat. If you’re angry, you’re optimistic you can stop this from happening again."
- "Anybody can become angry. According to Aristotle, that’s the easy part. But to be angry with the right person, and to the right degree, and at the right time, and for the right purpose, and in the right way. That’s not easy."
- "If you really want to kill your brother, Margot. Wait until you can get away with it. Or find someone to do it for you."
- "You look like a man who has suffered an irrevocable loss."
- "Every time you think about it, it stings, doesn't it? Wondering if I could be right about you. (then) Many troublesome behaviors strike when we are uncertain of ourselves."
- "Given extreme enough circumstances, we can all behave like psychopaths."
- "An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior."
- "If you're going to do this, Will... (whispers) You have to do it for yourself."
- "You would be wise to remain silent."
- "With all my knowledge and intrusion, I could never entirely predict you. I can feed the caterpillar, whisper through the chrysalis, but what hatches follows its own nature and is beyond me."
- "Must I denounce myself as a monster while you still refuse to see the one growing inside you?"
- "No one can be fully aware of another human being unless we love them. By that love we see potential in our beloved. Through that love we allow our beloved to see their potential. Expressing that love, our beloved's potential comes true. I love you, Will."
- "Memory gives moments immortality. But forgetfulness promotes a healthy mind. It’s good to forget. (then) What are you trying to forget?"
- "Therapy only works when we have a genuine desire to know ourselves as we are, not as we’d like to be. There is a duality to us all, Jack."
- "With every choice lies the possibility of regret. However, if I choose not to do something, it's usually for a good reason."
- "A life without regret would be no life at all."
- "Anticipating regret commonly results in dubious decisions. You must adapt your behavior to avoid feeling the same way again."
- "I want you to close your eyes, Will, and imagine a version of events you wouldn't have regretted."
- "Good. Remember that feeling."
- "You don't recognize in your brother basic human traits. You dehumanize him as much as he dehumanizes you."
- "The tendency to see others as less human than ourselves is universal."
- "Psychiatrists who dehumanize patients are more comfortable with painful-but-effective treatments, and experience better results."
- "Unless it went mad. A rabid animal attacks its victims at random and doesn't eat any part of them."
- "A therapist's life is equal parts counsel and curiosity. We set a patient on a path, but are left to wonder where that path takes them. You've come so very far, Randall."
- "No beast is more savage than man when possessed with power answerable to his own rage."
- "The way any animal thinks depends on limitations of mind and body. If we learn our limitations too soon, we never learn our power."
- "Animals are far more like humans than we ever realized. And humans are far more like animals. One thin barrier between us."
- "As he grew in wisdom and in confidence, he would no longer feel he had to meet his needs in hiding."
- "Persuasion is not coercion."
- "Every patient is unique."
- "Good and evil has nothing to do with God. I collect church collapses. Did you see the recent one in Sicily? The facade fell on sixty-five grandmothers during a special Mass. Was that evil? Was that God? If He's up there, He just loves it. Typhoid and swans, it all comes from the same place."
- "A beast doesn't know it's a beast, but the nearer a man gets to being a beast, the less he knows it."
- "Consider it an act of reciprocity. One positive action begets another."
- "Without death, we'd be at a loss. It's the prospect of death that drives us to greatness."
- "You have everywhere to go. As long as you buttress your mind against deterring forces like guilt. You should be quite pleased. I am."
- "Most of what we do, most of what we believe, is motivated by death."
- "A jarring reminder of death's informality."
- "This killer has no fear for the consequences of what he's done."
- "In love, you take leave of your senses, but in hatred, you must be present to calculate your actions."
- "One of the most-powerful forces that shapes us as human beings is the desire to leave a legacy. What legacy will you leave behind?"
- "Thin air is a musician's canvas.

  As therapists, we work with people the same way. Never touching, but finding wavelengths and frequencies to affect change. Guiding them from dissonance toward composition."
- "Much of what men do can be attributed to a desperate need to immortalize themselves. Women, however, can take a more direct route and create new life."
- "Even the worst of us needs someone to talk to, Mason. Have you ever considered therapy for yourself?"
- "Apart from humane considerations, it's more flavorful for animals to be stress-free prior to slaughter. This animal tastes frightened."
- "Evil's just destructive? Storms are evil, if it's that simple. And we have fire, and then there's hail. Under writers lump it all under 'Acts of God.'"
- "I don't hide from God."
- "A low heart rate is a true indicator of one's capacity for violence. One might say you are genetically predisposed to it."
- "Your design is evolving. Your choices affect the physical structures of your brain."
- "You must understand that blood and breath are only elements undergoing change to fuel your radiance. Just as the source of light is burning."
- "Through children we can disrupt our own sense of the past. We can protect them in ways we weren't."
- "Your father is dead. A boy's illusions are no basis for a man's life, Mason."
- "When men become fathers, they undergo biochemical changes that affect the way they think."
- "Fatherhood is not always a nurturing role. Fathers can be killers. In protecting a child, things trapped inside a man for years fly free, ready to explode in pain. And dangerous behavior. What sort of father would you be?"
- "How quickly we form attachments to something that does not yet exist."
- "We have a deep-seated need to interact with our children. It helps us discover who we are."
- "Occasionally, on purpose, I drop a teacup to shatter on the floor. I'm not satisfied when it doesn't gather itself up again. Someday perhaps a cup will come together."
- "Every creative act has its destructive consequence."
- "The Hindu god Shiva is simultaneous destroyer and creator. Who you were yesterday is laid waste to give rise to who you are today."
- "Your prayer did not go entirely unanswered. You saw part of her. (then) Should the universe contract, should time reverse and teacups come together, a place could be made for Abigail in your world."
- "I don't pray. I have not been bothered by any considerations of deity, other than to recognize how my own modest actions pale beside those of God."
- "God is beyond measure in wanton malice and matchless in His irony."
- "One can only see what one observes, and one observes only things which are already on the mind."
- The color that leaps out of black when lightning strikes the night?"
- "I have an understanding of your state of mind. You understand mine. We're just alike. This gives you the capacity to deceive me, and be deceived by me."
- "Mason is discourteous. Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me."
- "Whenever feasible, one should always try to eat the rude."
- "You said you were curious what would happen. I want you to close your eyes, Will. Imagine what you would like to happen."
- "God's choices in inflicting suffering are not satisfactory to us, nor are they understandable, unless innocence offends Him."
- "You have to find meaning in what's happened, Margot."
- "As you allow your emotions to unfold, you have to hone in on what can be, rather than what was done."
- "Dreams prepare us for waking life."
- "There are some extraordinary
circumstances here, Will. And some
unusual opportunities."
- "Mason Verger is a problem. Problem- solving is hunting. It is a savage pleasure and we are born to it. A savage pleasure we can share."
- "You're applying yourself to my perspective as I've been applying myself to yours."
- "An evocative shape -- in that at a certain point, it becomes unclear who’s pursuing whom."
- "Lack of trust in other people increases the need for religion. If you can't rely on others, you have to rely on God."
- "Whomever's pursuing whom, in this very moment, I intend to eat them."
- "A variety of psychedelic compounds, "psychedelic" so named from the Greek for "mind-revealing.""
- "Taste is housed in parts of the mind that proceed pity, and pity has no place at the table."
- "He did. Hiding and revealing identity is a constant theme throughout the Greek epics."
- "You sit in that chair, as you have so many times before. It holds among its molecules the vibrations of all our conversations ever held in its presence."
- "The grunts and poetry of life. It's all still there. Everything we've said. Listen. What do you hear?"
- "All of our destinies flying and swimming in blood and emptiness."
- "Little did Agent Crawford know what waited for him when he stepped into my office that very first time. How seldom we recognize the sound when the bolt of fate slides home."
- "Hesitation is a consequence of indecision or uncertainty. I'm not suffering from either. Are you?"
- "When the fox hears the rabbit scream, he comes a-runnin', but not to help."
- "The punctuation at the end of a sentence gives meaning to every word, every space that preceded it."
- "I hope you've found more reasons to live than not to."
- "Love and death are the great hinges on which all human sympathies turn. What we do for ourselves dies with us. What we do for others lives beyond us. You love Jack more than you love yourself."
- "The FBI will pore over my notes if I left them intact. I would spare my patients that scrutiny."
- "My palace is vast, even by medieval standards. The foyer is the Norman chapel in Palermo, severe and beautiful and timeless, with a single reminder of mortality: a skull graven in the floor."
- "In those moments, when you can't overcome your surroundings, you can make it all go away."
- "If I'm ever apprehended, my memory palace will serve as more than a mnemonic system, I will live there."
- "All the palace chambers are not lovely, light and high. In the vaults of our hearts and brains, danger waits. There are holes in the floor of the mind."
- "It's also a term from the dead religion of psychoanalysis. An imago is an image of a loved one buried in the unconscious, carried with us all our lives."
- "The concept of an ideal always searching for an objective reality to match. I have a concept of you just as you have a concept of me."
- "To the truth, then. And all its consequences."
- "The most-beautiful quality of a true friend is to understand and be understood with absolute clarity."
- "What a terrible and wonderful thing it is to see you."
- "I was hoping you and I wouldn't have to say good-bye. I imagined a farewell less sorrowful, less present, an echo. Nothing said nor seen. You may've thought that rude."
- "In your defense, I worked very hard to blind you. You can stay blind. You can hide from this. Walk away. I'll make no plans to call on you. But if you stay, I will kill you. Be blind, Alana. Don't be brave."
- "Fate and circumstance has returned us to the moment the teacup shatters. I forgive you, Will"
- "One can appreciate another's words without dissecting them. Though, on occasion, dissection is the only thing that will do."
- "The Devil has been a yoke on the neck of humanity since we first began to think and dream. I for a much shorter time."
- "This isn't cannibalism, Abel. It's only cannibalism if we're equals."
- "It's called 'terminal restlessness.' The body fills with adrenaline and feels compelled to go-go-go."
- "The eating of the heart is a powerful image."
- "I'm happy to sing for my supper."
- "I've found a peace here that I would preserve. I've killed hardly anybody during our residence."
- "Morality doesn't exist. Only morale."
- "Human motivation can be little more than lucid greed."
- "I've kept cochlear gardens since I was a young man, fattening snails on herbs and vine leaves. Like all of us, what they eat greatly influences and enhances their flavor."
- "When agitated, sea snails produce a purple dye. Its color won't fade. Becomes brighter with weathering."
- "Dante wrote that fear is almost as bitter as death."
- "This wasn’t reckless violence. It was a controlled use of force."
- "Aggression can be an effective means of maintaining order when dealing with an unruly patient."
- "I’m sure you reacted with a level of aggression that was uniquely appropriate for this encounter. But you weren’t defending yourself."
- "I can help you tell the version of events you want to be told. I can help you, if you ask me to."
- "Now that ceaseless exposure has calloused us to the lewd and the vulgar, it is instructive to see what still seems wicked to us."
- "You cannot control with respect to whom you fall in love."
- "It's not healing to see your childhood home, but it helps you measure whether you are broken, how and why, assuming you want to know."
- "On my memory palace? Its door at the center of my mind. And here you are, feeling for the latch."
- "This room holds sound and motion, great snakes wrestling and heaving in the dark. Other rooms are static scenes, fragmentary..."
- "Punch Romaine, a cocktail created by Escoffier. Served to first-class guests on the Titanic during their last dinner."
- "I pay lots of attention. But not in a wide-eyed, indiscriminate way."
- "I'm spiraling. Life spirals."
- "You cannot preserve entropy. It gradually descends into disorder."
- "In Roman times each carcass was divided: prime cuts went to nobility, second to the clergy, third to the bourgeoisie, fourth to the army."
- "The innards of a carcass constitute roughly a quarter of its weight."
- "I say that without ego. I don't require conventional reinforcement."
- "I was rooting for Mephistopheles and contemptuous of Faust."
- "The god Betrayal. Who presupposes the god Forgiveness."
- "Mischa didn't betray me. She would influence me to betray myself. But I forgave her that influence."
- "Firefly larvae devour many times their own body weight in snails. Fuel to power a transformation into a delicate creature of such beauty."
- "Better to live true to yourself for an instant than never know it."
- "Empathy and reciprocity."
