- ### RAMPRASAD

  * O Mother! my desires are unfulfilled;  
  My hopes are ungratified;  
  But my life is fast coming to an end.  
  Let me call Thee, Mother, for the last time;  
  Come and take me in Thy arms.  
  None loves in this world;  
  This world knows not how to love;  
  My heart yearns, O Mother, to go there,  
  Where love reigns supreme.
  * Mother, am I Thine eight-months child?  
  Thy red eyes cannot frighten me!  
  My riches are Thy Lotus Feet,   
  which Shiva holds upon His breast;  
  Yet, when I seek my heritage,  
  I meet with excuses and delays.  
  A deed of gift I hold in my heart,  
  attested by Thy Husband Shiva;  
  I shall sue Thee, if I must,  
  and with a single point shall win.  
  If Thou dost oppose me,  
  Thou wilt learn what sort of mother's son I am.  
  This bitterly contested suit between the Mother and Her son,  
  "What sport it is!", says Ramprasad.  
  I shall not cease tormenting Thee  
  Till Thou Thyself shalt yield the fight  
  and take me in Thine arms at last.

  * I drink no ordinary wine,  
  but Wine of Everlasting Bliss,  
  As I repeat my Mother Kali's name;  
  It so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk!  
  First my guru gives molasses for the making of the Wine;  
  My longing is the ferment to transform it. Knowledge, the maker of the Wine,  
  prepares it for me then;  
  And when it is done,  
  my mind imbibes it from the bottle of the mantra,  
  Taking the Mother's name to make it pure.  
  Drink of this Wine, says Ramprasad,  
  and the four fruits 16 of life are yours

  * This time I shall devour Thee utterly, Mother Kali!  
  For I was born under an evil star,  
  And one so born becomes, they say, the eater of his mother.  
  Thou must devour me first, or I myself shall eat Thee up;  
  One or the other it must be.  
  I shall besmear my hands with black  
  and with black my face;  
  With black I shall besmear the whole of my body.  
  And when Death seizes me,  
  with black I shall besmear his face.  
  O Mother, I shall eat Thee up  
  but not digest Thee;  
  I shall install Thee in my heart  
  And make Thee offerings with my mind.
  You may say that by eating Kali  
  I shall embroil myself  
  With Kala, 35 Her Husband,  
  but I am not afraid;  
  Braving His anger,  
  I shall chant my Mother's name.  
  Come what may, I shall eat Thee up—  
  Thee and Thy retinue—  
  Or lose my life attempting it.

  * O Mother Kali with a necklace of human heads!  
  What magic hast Thou shown me!  
  O Mother! Thou didst teach me how to call Thee "mother,"  
  and make me mad by calling Thee "mother" constantly.  
  Tell me, O Mother Tara,  
  where Thou didst get such a name full of nectar  
  Worldly people call me mad Prasad  
  whenever they meet me.  
  Even the members of my family call me names.  
  But do I deviate from my path,  
  O Mother Kali, being misled by their abuses?  
  Let them say whatever they like;  
  I will always mutter 'Kali,’ 'Kali.’  
  Honor and dishonor are all alike to me;  
  I have cast aside maya,  
  And made Thy rosy feet the be-all-and-end-all of my life;  
  shall I be misguided by worldly people anymore?

  * O mind! be absorbed in the feet of Mother who destroys all fears;  
  If thou want to be saved from great dangers and distress.  
  Meditate safely, O mind, on Her blessed feet, which destroy death;  
  On whose greatness Siva meditates -- the presence of presence is i mpossible;  
  But the absence of absence is easy; whose wealth exists at every step.  
  O Tongue! I Earnestly request thee to say: "O Kali, sanding on Siva as a corpse,  
  I pray thee, O giver of gifts, grant Prasada the coveted boon."
